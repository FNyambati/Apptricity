Expense Management System using HTML5, CSS3, and AngularJS


------UPDATE AFTER FINISHING FUCTIONAL PORTIONS -------
Please pardon the styling, I went for a functional product and ran out of time!
I used gulp for sass styling purposes only, I could have concatnated my JS files but that was unneccessary given the small amount of JS files.
This was a great app for me to work on, it tested my abilites to manipulate data without the use of a database. As a solution, I intergrated Local storage for keeping data in your browser and yours only. A challenge for me was editing expenses, parsing data, and keeping everything from breaking! Things I'll need to improve on is finding a proper way to calculate tax and filter dates in my ui-grid, those were things I failed to do. Hope it doesnt hurt my chances. I hope you like what I put together!
